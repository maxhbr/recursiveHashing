* This is experimental and tries to understand how to hash tree structures like JSON or YAML

** Basics:
- all strings are encoded with Utf8
- we have chosen an hashing algorithm (lets go for sha256), that consumes ByteStrings
- we have a function that renders a hash as a string in Base64 encoding
** hashes of base types
*** Hashing "null"
*** Hashing "true"
*** Hashing "false"
*** Hashing number
*** Hashing string
** hashes of recursive types
*** Hashing array
*** Hashing object
**** Hashing object members
